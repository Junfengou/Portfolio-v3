                <h3>I'm an web developer from Omaha, Nebraska who enjoy to create things that live on the internet.
                    My passion in web development sparked in 2019 when one of my friend show me his web project. 
                    The power of combining art and code to create something truly unique was something I have never thought possible.
                    From that moment on, I have decided to embark on this journey of web discovery.
